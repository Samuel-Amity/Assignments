Types of Load Balancers in AWS
Application Load Balancer (ALB)

Use case: Best suited for HTTP and HTTPS traffic. It operates at the Layer 7 (Application Layer) of the OSI model.
Features:
Intelligent routing based on URL, hostname, headers, or request parameters.
Ideal for microservices and containerized applications.
Network Load Balancer (NLB)

Use case: Designed for handling TCP and UDP traffic at the Layer 4 (Transport Layer). Suitable for high-performance and low-latency applications.
Features:
Capable of managing millions of requests per second.
Best for real-time applications like gaming or financial services.
Classic Load Balancer (CLB)

Use case: Legacy option supporting both Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) and Layer 4 (TCP/SSL) traffic.
Features:
Basic load balancing for applications developed on older architectures.
Typically used in applications that do not require the advanced routing and features of ALB or NLB.
