What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk?
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of web applications and services. It provides a quick and efficient way for developers to deploy applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure, allowing them to focus on writing code and developing features.

Key Features
Automatic Scaling:
Elastic Beanstalk automatically adjusts the number of instances running your application based on the current load. This ensures that the application remains responsive and can handle varying traffic levels.

Multiple Language Support:
Elastic Beanstalk supports several programming languages and frameworks, including:

Java
.NET
Node.js
PHP
Python
Ruby
Go
Integrated Management Tools:
It provides a management console that allows users to monitor application health, view logs, and manage application versions. Additionally, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and SDKs can be used for programmatic access.

Built-in Load Balancing:
Elastic Beanstalk automatically provisions load balancers to distribute incoming traffic among multiple instances, improving application availability and fault tolerance.

Customization:
Developers can customize the environment configuration, including instance types, scaling policies, and networking settings, giving them flexibility in managing their applications.

Monitoring and Logging:
It integrates with Amazon CloudWatch to provide monitoring and alerting for application performance and health. Logs can be accessed easily for troubleshooting.

Deployment Options:
Users can deploy applications using several methods, including uploading code through the management console, using Git for source control, or integrating with CI/CD pipelines.
