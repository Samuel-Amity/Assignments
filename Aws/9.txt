EBS Volume Types Overview

General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3)

Description: Provides a balanced price and performance for a wide range of workloads.
Performance Characteristics:
gp2: Up to 16,000 IOPS and 250 MB/s max throughput.
gp3: Up to 16,000 IOPS and 1,000 MB/s max throughput (with the ability to provision IOPS and throughput independently).
Use Cases:
Boot volumes
Small to medium-sized databases
Development and testing environments
Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2)

Description: Designed for I/O-intensive applications that require low latency and high IOPS.
Performance Characteristics:
io1: Up to 64,000 IOPS (depends on instance type).
io2: Up to 256,000 IOPS with increased durability.
Use Cases:
Large relational databases
Mission-critical applications requiring sustained IOPS performance
Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)

Description: A low-cost HDD for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads.
Performance Characteristics: Max throughput of 500 MB/s and 40 MB/s per TB.
Use Cases:
Big data analytics
Data warehousing
Log processing
Cold HDD (sc1)

Description: The lowest-cost HDD for infrequently accessed data.
Performance Characteristics: Max throughput of 250 MB/s and 12 MB/s per TB.
Use Cases:
Archival storage
Backup solutions
Data that is rarely accessed
Magnetic (standard)

Description: An older technology; lower cost for less frequently accessed data.
Performance Characteristics: Lower performance compared to SSD options, with up to 40-90 IOPS per volume.
Use Cases:
Boot volumes for non-critical applications
Data requiring infrequent access
