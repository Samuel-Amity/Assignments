1. Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a pre-configured template used to launch EC2 instances. It includes:

Operating system (e.g., Linux, Windows).
Application server and software (e.g., Apache, MySQL).
AMIs serve as "blueprints" to create instances with predefined setups.
AMIs can be:
Public AMIs (provided by AWS or third parties).
Private AMIs (custom-built for specific needs).

2. Security Group
A Security Group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances.
Key features:

Inbound rules: Specify what traffic is allowed to reach the instance (e.g., allowing HTTP on port 80).
Outbound rules: Specify what traffic can leave the instance.
Stateful: If traffic is allowed in, the corresponding response is automatically allowed out.

3. Instance Types
Instance Types define the hardware specifications of an EC2 instance, such as:

CPU, memory, storage, and network performance. AWS offers various instance types for different workloads:
General-purpose instances (e.g., t2.micro): Balanced for a variety of applications.
Specialized instances (e.g., m5.large for memory-optimized, p3.xlarge for GPU workloads).

4. Key Pair
A Key Pair is a set of security credentials used for SSH or RDP access to EC2 instances. It consists of:

Public key: Stored by AWS on the instance.
Private key: Held by you, used to access the instance. Key pairs ensure secure login:
Linux instances: Use the private key for SSH.
Windows instances: Use the private key to decrypt the administrator password for RDP access.
