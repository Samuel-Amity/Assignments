Difference between Compiler and Interpreter


   Compiler


Compiler Takes Entire program as
input

Intermediate Object Code is
Generated

Conditional Control Statements are
Executes faster

Memory Requirement: More
(Since Object Code is Generated)

Program need not be compiled every
time

Errors are displayed after entire
program is checked

Example: C Compiler

Interpreter

Interpreter Takes Single instruction as
input.

No Intermediate Object Code is
Generated

Conditional Control Statements are
Executes slower

Memory Requirement is Less

Every time higher level program is
converted into lower level program

Errors are displayed for every
instruction interpreted (if any)

Example: BASIC
